Node.js application that takes in the user's command for which search to use and the term they would like to search then outputs data accordingly.



Concert-This:

In terminal a user will type: 

node liri concert-this lady gaga

The output will be a short clip with data on venue, location, and date.

Spotify-This-Song:

In terminal the user will type:

node liri spotify-this-song chihiro

The output will be the artist name, track title, a link to preview the song
and the album title.

Movie-This:

In terminal the user will type:

node liri movie-this saw

The output will be the movie title, imdb rating, rotten tomatoes rating, country produced, language, and plot.

Do-What-It-Says:

In terminal the user will type:

node liri do-what-it-says

This command is special in that it takes in two parameters. The first will go into the case-switch statement and figure out which search to run, and the second is the search term the user would like to look for.
